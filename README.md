ggd3
====

Just got started. Come back in a couple of weeks and we'll see how things are going.

Based on the [gg](https://github.com/gigamonkey/gg) project by gigamonkey. GGD3 takes the same approach, but is "facets first" in the way that Bootstrap is mobile first.

Grab ggd3.js and ggd3.css to use the project immediately.

Check out the examples in test.js to see it in action.

To get hacking, `git clone`, `npm install`, and `gulp install` to grab dependencies. Tests run locally and in the browser and can be viewed by opening test.html or with `gulp test`.
